# Changes

## 0.7.2

Release date: 2016-02-24

* Fix misuse of `max_allowed_packet` parameter. (#426, #407 and #397)
* Add %(name)s plceholder support to `Cursor.executemany()`. (#427, thanks to
  @WorldException)

## 0.7.1

Release date: 2016-01-14

* Fix auth fail with MySQL 5.1
* Fix escaping unicode fails on Python 2

## 0.7

Release date: 2016-01-10

* Faster binary escaping
* Add `"_binary" prefix` to string literal for binary types.
  binary types are: `bytearray` on Python 2, `bytes` and `bytearray` on Python 3.
  This is because recent MySQL show warnings when string literal is invalid for
  connection encoding.
* `pymysql.Binary()` returns `bytearray` on Python 2.  This is required to distinguish
  binary and string.
* Auth plugin support.
* no_delay option is ignored.  It will be removed in PyMySQL 0.8.

* Add Cursor.mogrify() method
* no_delay option is deprecated and True by default
* Fix options from my.cnf overrides options from arguments
* Allow socket like object.  (It's not feature for end users)
* Strip quotes while reading options from my.cnf file
