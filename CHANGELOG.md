# Changes

## v1.1.0

Release date: TBD

* Fixed SSCursor raising OperationalError for query timeouts on wrong statement (#1032)
* Exposed `Cursor.warning_count` to check for warnings without additional query (#1056)
* Make Cursor iterator (#995)
* Support '_' in key name in my.cnf (#1114)
* `Cursor.fetchall()` returns empty list instead of tuple (#1115). Note that `Cursor.fetchmany()` still return empty tuple after reading all rows for compatibility with Django.
* Deprecate Error classes in Cursor class (#1117)
* Add `Connection.set_character_set(charset, collation=None)` (#1119)
* Deprecate `Connection.set_charset(charset)` (#1119)

  Since collation table is vary on MySQL server versions, collation in handshake is fragile.
