PyMySQL Installation

   This package contains a pure-Python MySQL client library.
   Documentation on the MySQL client/server protocol can be found here:
   http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/MySQL_Internals_ClientServer_Protocol
   If you would like to run the test suite, create a ~/.my.cnf file and
   a database called "test_pymysql". The goal of pymysql is to be a drop-in
   replacement for MySQLdb and work on CPython 2.3+, Jython, IronPython, PyPy
   and Python 3. We test for compatibility by simply changing the import
   statements in the Django MySQL backend and running its unit tests as well
   as running it against the MySQLdb and myconnpy unit tests.

Changes
--------
0.4  -Miscellaneous bug fixes
     -Implementation of SSL support
     -Implementation of kill()
0.3  -Implemented most of the extended DBAPI 2.0 spec including callproc()
     -Fixed error handling to include the message from the server and support
      multiple protocol versions.
     -Implemented ping()
     -Implemented unicode support (probably needs better testing)
     -Removed DeprecationWarnings
     -Ran against the MySQLdb unit tests to check for bugs
     -Added support for client_flag, charset, sql_mode, read_default_file,
      use_unicode, cursorclass, init_command, and connect_timeout. 
     -Refactoring for some more compatibility with MySQLdb including a fake
      pymysql.version_info attribute.
     -Now runs with no warnings with the -3 command-line switch
     -Added test cases for all outstanding tickets and closed most of them.
     -Basic Jython support added.
     -Fixed empty result sets bug.
     -Integrated new unit tests and refactored the example into one.
     -Fixed bug with decimal conversion.
     -Fixed string encoding bug. Now unicode and binary data work!
     -Added very basic docstrings.

0.2  -Changed connection parameter name 'password' to 'passwd'
      to make it more plugin replaceable for the other mysql clients.
     -Changed pack()/unpack() calls so it runs on 64 bit OSes too.
     -Added support for unix_socket.
     -Added support for no password.
     -Renamed decorders to decoders.
     -Better handling of non-existing decoder.
