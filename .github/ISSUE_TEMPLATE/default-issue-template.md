This project is maintained by one busy person with a frail wife, and an infant daughter.
My time and energy is a very limited resource. I'm not a teacher, or free tech support.
Don't ask questions here.  Don't file an issue unless you believe it's not a problem with your code.
Search for friendly volunteers who can teach you, or review your code on ML or Q&A sites.
