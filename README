PyMySQL Installation
====================

   This package contains a pure-Python MySQL client library.
   Documentation on the MySQL client/server protocol can be found here:
   http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/MySQL_Internals_ClientServer_Protocol
   If you would like to run the test suite, create a ~/.my.cnf file and
   a database called "test_pymysql". The goal of pymysql is to be a drop-in
   replacement for MySQLdb and work on CPython 2.3+, Jython, IronPython, PyPy
   and Python 3. We test for compatibility by simply changing the import
   statements in the Django MySQL backend and running its unit tests as well
   as running it against the MySQLdb and myconnpy unit tests.
