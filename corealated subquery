A corealated subquery is a subquery that is excuted once far each row in the main query.
In contrast an uncorelated subquery is excuted only once.
a corealted subquery refers to a value that is provided by a column in the main query.
for each differnt value that is returned by the main query for that column the subquery returns a different result.
to refer to a column in the main query you can qualify the column with a table name as alias.
if a colrealted subquery uses the same table as the main query you can use table alias to remove ambiguity.
since corealted subqueries can be different to code. 
you may have to test a subquery seperately before using it within another select statement.
